BACKGROUND STORY:

* Cyclistics's marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments
* Cyclistics has flexible pricing plans: 
	- single-ride passes, full-day passes; ( casual riders )

	- annual memberships ( members )

* According to Cyclistics's finance analysts, annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. 
	# Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers;
	Moreno (Director of marketing) believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth.
	
	# Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes
	there is a solid opportunity to convert casual riders into members

* Design marketing team has set a clear goal:
	## Converting casual riders into annual members, the team needs to better understand:	
		1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
		2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
		3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

	## The team is interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.

* Now, assigned with the first question, (How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?)
	## Produce a report with these deliverables:
		1. A clear statement of the business task
		2. A description of all data sources used
		3. Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data
		4. A summary of your analysis
		5. Supporting visualizations and key findings
